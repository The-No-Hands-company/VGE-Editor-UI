# VersaUI Engine Integration Notes

## Frame Rate and Performance Integration

### Current Implementation
- Fixed ~60 FPS update rate
- Basic frame limiting
- Simple VSync support
- Independent from engine state

### Required Future Implementation (Following Slate Model)
1. **Dynamic Frame Rate System**
   - Tie UI update rate to engine's performance state
   - Adapt based on current UI state (static vs. interactive)
   - Optimize resource usage based on actual needs

2. **Integration Points**
   ```cpp
   // Example of future integration with engine tick
   class VersaUI {
       void Tick(float DeltaTime) {
           // Fast path for static UI
           if (!HasActiveAnimations() && !IsUserInteracting()) {
               // Minimal updates
               UpdateEssentialElements();
               return;
           }

           // Full updates for interactive states
           UpdateLayout();
           UpdateAnimations();
           ProcessInput();
           RenderWidgets();
       }
   };
   ```

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduce update frequency for static elements
   - Full speed updates during:
     - Animations
     - Drag operations
     - Continuous user interaction
     - Real-time data updates

4. **Resource Management**
   - Smart batching of render calls
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Cache management
   - State tracking

5. **Engine Synchronization**
   - Sync with engine's main loop
   - Handle variable frame rates
   - Support both editor and runtime contexts
   - Performance monitoring and adaptation

### Implementation Priority
This optimization should be implemented after:
1. Basic UI framework is stable
2. Core widgets are functioning
3. Basic rendering pipeline is complete
4. Input system is working

### Benefits
- Better resource utilization
- Improved battery life on mobile devices
- Smoother integration with game performance
- Better editor experience
- More efficient power usage

### Technical Requirements
- Engine tick system integration
- Performance monitoring system
- State tracking for UI elements
- Smart update scheduling
- Resource usage optimization

## Note for Development Team
This is a critical optimization that should be considered during the initial architecture design, even though it will be implemented later. The current implementation should be structured in a way that makes this transition smoother when the time comes.
