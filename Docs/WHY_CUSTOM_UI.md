- Adaptable to various user needs
- No compromises on accessibility features

### 2. Performance Control
- Direct OpenGL integration
- Optimized rendering pipeline
- No unnecessary overhead
- Custom memory management
- Tailored for game development

### 3. Full Customization
- Complete control over widget behavior
- Custom rendering techniques
- Flexible theming system
- No framework limitations
- Future-proof architecture

### 4. Integration with VersaEngine
- Seamless engine integration
- Shared resource management
- Consistent performance profile
- Unified development experience

### 5. Independence
- No external dependencies
- No license restrictions
- No version conflicts
- Complete control over features
- Future-proof development

## Benefits Over External Solutions
